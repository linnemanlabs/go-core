// Package ratelimit is middleware for per-ip rate limiting
//
// # Simple in-memory implementation, not shared between instances or distributed
//
// What this does protect against:
//   - single ip flooding app (connection/goroutine exhaustion)
//   - gives observability insight into who/what/when/where/how (you still have to figure out why on your own..)
//   - single-log entry per offender to prevent log spam, metrics for counting total denied requests
//
// What this does NOT protect against:
//   - distributed attacks across many ips
//   - bandwidth-bill attacks, inbound data is already accepted by the time this runs
//
// This is designed to be a simple, self contained solution for defense in depth with upstream filtering.
// This specific app is extremely resilient (no long-lived db connections, process cache, internal states, etc), so this is an attempt to mitigate resource exhaustion and provide better visibility into abuse.
// We only allow ipv4 traffic currently, this would not do much on ipv6 without further logic to examine prefixes and ranges
